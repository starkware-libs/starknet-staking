## Staking Contract
### Functions
#### stake
Before:
```rust
fn stake(
       ref self: TContractState,
       reward_address: ContractAddress,
       operational_address: ContractAddress,
       amount: Amount,
       pool_enabled: bool,
       commission: Commission,
   );
```
After:
```rust
fn stake(
       ref self: TContractState,
       reward_address: ContractAddress,
       operational_address: ContractAddress,
       amount: Amount,
   );
```
Changes:
1. Remove `pool_enabled` and `commission` parameters - cant open pool in stake, must call `set_open_for_delegation`

#### update_commission
Before: 
```rust
fn update_commission(ref self: TContractState, commission: Commission);
```
After:
```rust
fn set_commission(ref self: TContractState, commission: Commission);
```
Changes:
1. Rename from `update_commission` to `set_commission` - if commission is not initialized - initialize it with the given commission. Else, update the commission with the same behavior as `update_commission` from prev version.
Note: The same commission applies to all pools per staker.

#### set_open_for_delegation
Before: 
   ```rust
   fn set_open_for_delegation(ref self: TContractState, commission: Commission) -> ContractAddress;
   ```
After:
   ```rust
   fn set_open_for_delegation(ref self: TContractState, token_address: ContractAddress) -> ContractAddress;
   ```
Changes:
1. Remove `commission` parameter - must initialize commission with `set_commission` before open a pool.
Note: If staker already has a commission from the prev version (of the STRK pool), he shouldnt reinitialize it. The same commission applies to all pools per staker.
2. Add `token_address` parameter - open a pool for a specific supported token.

#### get_pool_exit_intent
Before:
```rust
fn get_pool_exit_intent(
       self: @TContractState, undelegate_intent_key: UndelegateIntentKey,
   ) -> UndelegateIntentValue;
```
```rust
pub struct UndelegateIntentValue {
   pub unpool_time: Timestamp,
   pub amount: Amount,
}
```
Changes:
1. Delete `get_pool_exit_intent` function.

#### increase_stake
Before:
```rust
fn increase_stake(ref self: TContractState, staker_address: ContractAddress, amount: Amount) -> Amount;
```
After:
```rust
fn increase_stake(ref self: TContractState, staker_address: ContractAddress, amount: Amount) -> Amount;
```
Changes:
1. Change return value - in the previous version, the return value was the new total stake amount (self + delegated) of the staker. Now, the return value is the new self stake amount.

#### get_current_total_staking_power
Before:
```rust
fn get_current_total_staking_power(self: @TContractState) -> Amount;
```
After:
```rust
fn get_current_total_staking_power(self: @TContractState) -> (NormalizedAmount, NormalizedAmount);
```
Changes:
1. Change return type to tuple of (NormalizedAmount, NormalizedAmount) - first amount is the total staking power of the STRK token (same as before), second amount is the total staking power of the BTC active tokens. Both amounts are normalized to 18 decimals.

### Events
#### CommissionChanged
Before:
```rust
pub struct CommissionChanged {
       #[key]
       pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
       #[key]
       pub pool_contract: ContractAddress,
       pub new_commission: Commission,
       pub old_commission: Commission,
   }
```
After:
```rust
pub struct CommissionChanged {
       #[key]
       pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
       pub new_commission: Commission,
       pub old_commission: Commission,
   }
```
Changes:
1. Remove `pool_contract` (key) - commission can be set even before a staker opens a pool.

#### DeleteStaker
Before:
```rust
pub struct DeleteStaker {
       #[key]
       pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
       pub reward_address: ContractAddress,
       pub operational_address: ContractAddress,
       pub pool_contract: Option<ContractAddress>,
   }
```
After:
```rust
pub struct DeleteStaker {
       #[key]
       pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
       pub reward_address: ContractAddress,
       pub operational_address: ContractAddress,
       pub pool_contracts: Span<ContractAddress>,
   }
```
Changes:
1. Rename `pool_contract` to `pool_contracts`.
2. Change type from `Option<ContractAddress>` to `Span<ContractAddress>` - staker may have more than one pool.

#### StakerRewardsUpdated
Before:
```rust
pub struct StakerRewardsUpdated {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   pub staker_rewards: Amount,
   pub pool_rewards: Amount,
}
```
After:
```rust
pub struct StakerRewardsUpdated {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   pub staker_rewards: Amount,
   pub pool_rewards: Span<(ContractAddress, Amount)>,
}
```
Changes:
1. Change type of `pool_rewards` to `Span<(ContractAddress, Amount)>` - now holds tuples of (pool_contract, pool_rewards) for each pool that gets rewards.

#### StakerExitIntent
Before:
```rust
pub struct StakerExitIntent {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   pub exit_timestamp: Timestamp,
   pub amount: Amount,
}
```
After:
```rust
pub struct StakerExitIntent {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   pub exit_timestamp: Timestamp,
}
```
Changes:
1. Remove `amount` field.

#### StakeBalanceChanged
Before:
```rust
pub struct StakeBalanceChanged {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   pub old_self_stake: Amount,
   pub old_delegated_stake: Amount,
   pub new_self_stake: Amount,
   pub new_delegated_stake: Amount,
}
```
After:
```rust
pub struct StakeOwnBalanceChanged {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   pub old_self_stake: Amount,
   pub new_self_stake: Amount,
}
```
```rust
pub struct StakeDelegatedBalanceChanged {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub token_address: ContractAddress,
   pub old_delegated_stake: Amount,
   pub new_delegated_stake: Amount,
}
```
Changes:
1. Split `StakeBalanceChanged` event to `StakeOwnBalanceChanged` (staker self stake) and `StakeDelegatedBalanceChanged` (staker delegated stake - per token).
2. `StakeOwnBalanceChanged` holds `old_self_stake` and `new_self_stake` but not `old_delegated_stake` and `new_delegated_stake`.
3. `StakeDelegatedBalanceChanged` holds `token_address`, and `old_delegated_stake` and `new_delegated_stake` for the specific token.

#### NewDelegationPool
Before:
```rust
pub struct NewDelegationPool {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub pool_contract: ContractAddress,
   pub commission: Commission,
}
```
After:
```rust
pub struct NewDelegationPool {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub pool_contract: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub token_address: ContractAddress,
   pub commission: Commission,
}
```
Changes:
1. Add `token_address` keyed field - the token address of the pool.

#### RemoveFromDelegationPoolIntent
Before:
```rust
pub struct RemoveFromDelegationPoolIntent {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub pool_contract: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub identifier: felt252,
   pub old_intent_amount: Amount,
   pub new_intent_amount: Amount,
}
```
After:
```rust
pub struct RemoveFromDelegationPoolIntent {
   #[key]
   pub staker_address: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub pool_contract: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub token_address: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub identifier: felt252,
   pub old_intent_amount: Amount,
   pub new_intent_amount: Amount,
}
```
Changes:
1. Add `token_address` keyed field - the token address of the pool.

#### RemoveFromDelegationPoolAction
Before:
```rust
pub struct RemoveFromDelegationPoolAction {
   #[key]
   pub pool_contract: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub identifier: felt252,
   pub amount: Amount,
}
```
After:
```rust
pub struct RemoveFromDelegationPoolAction {
   #[key]
   pub pool_contract: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub token_address: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub identifier: felt252,
   pub amount: Amount,
}
```
Changes:
1. Add `token_address` keyed field - the token address of the pool.

#### ChangeDelegationPoolIntent
Before:
```rust
pub struct ChangeDelegationPoolIntent {
   #[key]
   pub pool_contract: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub identifier: felt252,
   pub old_intent_amount: Amount,
   pub new_intent_amount: Amount,
}
```
After:
```rust
pub struct ChangeDelegationPoolIntent {
   #[key]
   pub pool_contract: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub token_address: ContractAddress,
   #[key]
   pub identifier: felt252,
   pub old_intent_amount: Amount,
   pub new_intent_amount: Amount,
}
```
Changes:
1. Add `token_address` keyed field - the token address of the pool.

## Reward Supplier Contract
### Functions
#### calculate_current_epoch_rewards
Before:
```rust
fn calculate_current_epoch_rewards(self: @TContractState) -> Amount;
```
After:
```rust
fn calculate_current_epoch_rewards(self: @TContractState) -> (Amount, Amount);
```
Changes:
