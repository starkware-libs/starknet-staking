## About
This repo holds the implementation of Starknet's staking mechanism.  
Following [Starknet SNIP 18](https://community.starknet.io/t/snip-18-staking-s-first-stage-on-starknet/114334).

## Disclaimer
Staking is a work in progress.

## Dependencies
The project is built with [Turbo repo](https://turbo.build/) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).  
Turbo's installation process will also install the cairo dependencies such as [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) and [Starknet foundry](https://foundry-rs.github.io/starknet-foundry/index.html).

## Installation
Clone the repo and from within the project's root folder run:
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
nvm install 20
curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
pnpm install turbo --global
pnpm install
```

## Implementation specification
Specs document found [here](docs/spec.md)

## Verify Class Hash
To ensure that the on-chain class hash corresponds to the code in this repository, follow these steps:
- :wrench: Environment Requirements
  - sncast version:
    - `sncast --version` -> `0.50.0`
    - if not, install sncast:
      - `asdf install starknet-foundry 0.50.0`
      - `asdf global starknet-foundry 0.50.0`
      - `asdf local starknet-foundry 0.50.0`
- :mag: Verification Steps
  - Checkout the Correct Code Version
    - Make sure you're on the exact Git commit or tag used for deployment:
      - `git checkout <commit-hash-or-tag>`
      - commit_hash: `5c11a5689f2d2e08ffecebf30d3e49569accbfca`
      - tag: `@staking/contracts-v1.0.1-dev.854`
  - Compute the Local Class Hash
    - Use Sncast to calculate the class hash of the local contract:
      - `sncast utils class-hash --contract-name <contract_name>`
      - where `<contract_name>` is the name of the contract (e.g. `Staking`, `Attestation`)
  - Compare with On-Chain Class Hash
    - Look up the deployed class hash on a block explorer (e.g., [StarkScan](https://starkscan.io/) or [Voyager](https://voyager.online/))
    - Ensure it matches the one computed locally
